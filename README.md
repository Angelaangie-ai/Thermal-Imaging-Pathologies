# Thermal Imaging Image Recognition Applied to Building Pathology Documentation

Due to climate change and to the environmental impact caused by the construction industry, repurposing existing buildings and making them more energy-efficient has become a high-priority issue. On the other side, infrared thermography has been used to characterize buildingsâ€™ state of conservation, through the detection of pathologies, such as cracks, presence of vegetation and humidity. Thermal cameras detect the radiation emitted by any material and translate it into temperature color-coded images, and abnormal temperature variations may indicate the presence of pathologies. However, reading thermal images might not be quite simple, since several factors affect the results of thermographic tests.

Given that, this research project aims to combine infrared thermography, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) to help stakeholders determine the viability of reusing existing buildings, by identifying their pathologies and defects more efficiently and accurately.
